Association rules are statements of the form "98% of customers that purchase tires and  automobile accessories also get automotive services
To overcome the issue of discovering association rules between items in large database, two  algorithm were proposed and the issue was discovering the Association rules between items in large  database.Two algorithms were introduced “Apriori” and “AprioriTid”.
These two combined as a hybrid model called “AprioriHybrid”
Synthetic data proved that these algorithm outperform previous algorithm by factors ranging from  three for small ones to more than order of magnitude.Scale up experiments show that hybrid algo  scales linearly with no of transactions ad it has excellent scale up properties w.r.t transaction size and  no of items in the database
Conclusion:
These two combined Hybrid algorithm with their scale-up properties demonstrate the feasibility of using  this hybrid one and implementing them for real time application involving large databases

CODE:
pip install apyori

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from apyori import apriori

df=pd.read_excel("pseudo_facebook2.xlsx")

df.shape

transactions = []            //all the ordered list are stored in this array

for i in range(0,2280):
   transactions.append([str(df.values[i,j]) for j in range(0,2)])

transactions                // this is the output obtained which indicates that the connection is taking place from A to B

rules = apriori(transactions = transactions,min_support = 0.001,min_confidence = 0.01,min_lift = 0.5)

results = list(rules)
results

result = pd.DataFrame(results)
result
