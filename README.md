# Finding-influential-users-in-a-socialnetwork
Using BDA, MCDM algorithms and ARM techniques we will find the influential users in social network 

Social media is one of the biggest platform in the world that is used to influence people.
One of the important part is the "Information Diffusion" which is kind of attractive field of  research and applications of knowledge extraction and prediction.
But still there are some issues that will be rectified with the use of association rules mining  and graph theory respectively.
As we all know that people influence each other through social media and is possible to  find them based on their previous interactions in Social Network.
We use an approach called "Association techniques" to extract the hidden relationship  between users.
For evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach we propose a new method  called " The Completeness Centrality" and perform an evaluation based on case study from  then literature.
To find the effectiveness of the proposed centrality measure, we use a method called  susceptible-infected-recovered model and the overlapping similarity measure.
The obtained results will demonstrate that our measure is feasible and is effective for  use in identifying influential spreaders, based on a specific comparison with already  existing centrality measures such as "degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector  methods‚Äù.
To illustrate this demo, we will conduct an experiment that runs on 25 generated  diffusion graphs, and the results obtained will show that our approach will achieve a  higher level of performance in terms of " Computational time" for large scale networks.
